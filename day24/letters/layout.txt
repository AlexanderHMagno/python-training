Dear [name],

I hope this letter finds you well! I'm excited to invite you to my birthday celebration!

The party will be held on Saturday, July 15th at 3:00 PM at my house.
We'll have lots of fun activities, delicious food, and of course - cake!

Please let me know if you can make it. I really hope you can join us for this special day!

Best wishes,
Alexander
